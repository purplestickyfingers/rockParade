Rather insulting, actually, since I've been following the trajectory calculations for three weeks now. I know exactly what's coming.

Mother packed the evacuation bags on Tuesday. Father said we'd leave at dawn. It's past noon now, and the bags sit by the door like abandoned pets. Nobody mentions them anymore.

The sky has gone peculiar. That's the only word for it. The afternoon light tastes metallic, and there's a brightness growing in the west that shouldn't be there. Mr. Chen from next door is filming it on his phone, as if recording the end of the world might somehow make it less real. Someone down the block is crying, but most people are just standing in their gardens, watching. We're all terribly civilized about it.

I've kept this journal since I was twelve. Four years of melodramatic heartbreak over boys who never noticed me, agonizing over exam results that won't matter now. I'd imagined my final entry would be profound. Something about love transcending death, or the terrible beauty of existence, or how we're all made of stardust returning home.

But what I actually think is: we should have left yesterday.

The light is so bright now it's burning through my

The television showed ${asteroidName} for days - those serious-faced scientists with their careful words. "Possible impact." "Uncertain trajectory." Then "high probability of oceanic strike." Then nothing at all. Just static. The internet died an hour ago. Even the emergency broadcasts have given up their cheerful lies.

Jabu came over this morning. We've been dating for exactly three months and two days, which makes me laugh because I was counting. I was keeping track as if time would continue in its normal, ordered fashion. As if I'd get to tell our children someday about how we met in winter and fell in love by spring.

We sat on the roof. His hand was warm in mine, which seemed important somehow. Worth remembering. He didn't try to say anything profound, which I appreciated. All the profound things have already been said, haven't they?

And yet here I am, pen in hand, because Mrs. Van Der Merwe's voice is in my head saying "write what you feel, Lerato" as if feelings matter when you're about to be vaporized.

They cancelled school on Monday. Some families left - packed their cars with photograph albums and family bibles and drove to Johannesburg as if a hundred kilometers might save them. The rest of us stayed. Where exactly do you go when the scientists can't decide if it's the whole world ending or just our particular corner of it?

Zinhle and I went to the Voortrekker Monument yesterday. We climbed to the top even though they'd closed it. The security guard had already left. From up there you can see the whole city spread out, the jacaranda trees lining the streets in their October purple. It was absurdly beautiful, indifferent to ${asteroidName} hurtling toward it. We sat up there for hours. Didn't say much. Didn't need to.

Father's workshop has gone silent. For sixteen years I've fallen asleep to the sound of him building things - cabinets, chairs, toys for the neighbor's children. Now he just sits with us, opening his mouth to speak, then closing it again. I think he wants to impart some final piece of fatherly wisdom. But what is there left to say that isn't either a lie or utterly obvious?

There's that poem we read in English. "Rage, rage against the dying of the light." But I don't feel rage. I feel

Coach doesn't cancel practice for anything. Not floods, not riots, not national emergencies. Last year when the riots reached our township, he made us run drills in the school gym with the doors locked. "The world keeps spinning," he'd say. "You keep training."

But Tuesday morning he just sat on the bench in the empty stadium and told us to go home. Be with our families. I asked him if he was going to his family. He shook his head. Said his family was in Durban. Too far to drive now. So I sat with him. Neither of us said much.

The team group chat has gone quiet. Usually it's chaos - memes, trash talk, someone always trying to start beef. Now it's just Sipho posting "I love you guys" every few hours. We all react with hearts but nobody knows what else to say.

Ma made my favorite dinner. Pap and morogo, the way Gogo taught her. The whole family eating together for the first time in months. My sister kept looking at her phone, then putting it down. Looking for news that isn't coming. Or maybe hoping for a miracle that definitely isn't.

Dad put on the Bulls game from 2009. The one where we beat the Crusaders. We've all seen it a hundred times. But we watched anyway, pretending this was just another Saturday. Pretending ${asteroidName} was just another headline we'd forget about in a week.

The sky is different now. Clearer somehow. Like the world is holding its breath.

I wish we'd made nationals. Stupid thing to think about but

The maize is ready. Perfect timing for a harvest that'll never happen. Pa stood there in the middle of the field, running his hand through the stalks the way Oupa taught him. Three generations of Van Wyks working this land. All for nothing now.

We drove to the old oak tree where Pa proposed to Ma. Sat there drinking rooibos from the flask. He told me stories I'd heard a thousand times - about Oupa, about the drought of '92, about the first time he drove a tractor. Like he was trying to make sure someone remembered.

"You're a good son," he said. Just like that. Out of nowhere. Pa doesn't say things like that. He clapped me on the shoulder and looked away real quick.

Ma had koeksisters waiting when we got back. The whole house smells like cinnamon and honey. She's been cooking all day - melktert, biltong, boerewors. Feeding us like we can take it with us wherever we're going next.

The dogs know something's wrong. Bliksem won't leave my side. Keeps pressing his head against my leg like he used to when he was a pup.

Everyone's here. Uncles I haven't seen since last Christmas, cousins from Johannesburg, even the neighbors from three houses down. Gogo's house is too small for all of us but nobody cares. We're sitting on the floor, on the stairs, spilling out into the yard. All of us together.

The grown-ups have stopped lying to us. That's how I know it's really happening. Usually they make up stories to make things sound better than they are. Not anymore. When I asked Baba if ${asteroidName} would miss us, he just pulled me close and said "I don't think so, my boy."

Nobody's looting. I thought people would riot, steal things, go crazy. But everyone's just... being nice. Strangers sharing food. The police joined the crowd and started directing traffic so people could dance in the street. Mrs. Chen from the Chinese restaurant is handing out dumplings for free.

It's the most Pretoria thing I've ever seen. The end of the world and we're having a street party.

Bought a chocolate from the corner shop with the last of my data. Phoned my ex to say I was sorry for how things ended. He said he was sorry too. We talked for an hour about nothing important. Everything important.

My roommate and I climbed onto the roof of our res. The stars are incredible tonight. No light pollution anymore - everyone's turned their lights off to watch the sky. Or maybe to stop wasting electricity on a tomorrow that won't come. The Milky Way looks like someone spilled diamonds across black velvet.

We're taking turns pointing out constellations. Making up new ones. That one's the Jacaranda. That one's the Braai Fork. That one's Mrs. Malherbe's Disapproving Stare.

Someone's got a bluetooth speaker playing "Shosholoza". Everyone's singing along. Even the white kids who don't know all the words are trying. It's beautiful and absurd and so perfectly South African it makes my chest
